This project focuses on developing an automated waste classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to support sustainable waste management. The world faces serious environmental challenges due to rapid urbanization, industrialization, and waste generation. To tackle this issue, the project aims to create an intelligent model that can identify and classify different types of waste. This will promote recycling and eco-friendly disposal methods. 

The dataset used is the Recyclable and Household Waste Classification Dataset from Kaggle, which contains about 15,000 images categorized into 31 classes such as plastic, glass, metal, cardboard, and food waste. The project was implemented in Google Colab using Python and libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. The dataset was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to both train and evaluate the CNN model. 

The workflow includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, creating a web interface, and deployment. This project not only automates waste segregation, but it also contributes to sustainable development goals by reducing landfill waste and encouraging responsible consumption. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, building CNN models, and integrating AI for real-world environmental applications.
